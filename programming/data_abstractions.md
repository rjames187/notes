# Building Abstractions with Data

Native data types evaluate to values of native data types called literals.

There are built-in functions and operators to manipulate the values of native types.

## Data Abstraction

An abstract data type allows the manipulation of compound objects as units. 

Data abstractions: functions enforce an abstraction barrier between the representation and use of data.

## Sequences

A sequence is an ordered collection of values.

Common behavior of sequences:
- finite length
- every element corresponds to a non-negative integer index less than the sequence's length (starting at zero)

Examples of sequences:
- lists
- ranges
- tuples
- arrays
- strings
- linked lists (non-native)

## Mutable Data

Instances of primitive built-in objects are typically immutable.

Mutable objects represent values that change over time.
