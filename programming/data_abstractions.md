# Building Abstractions with Data

Native data types evaluate to values of native data types called literals.

There are built-in functions and operators to manipulate the values of native types.

## Data Abstraction

An abstract data type allows the manipulation of compound objects as units. 

Data abstractions: functions enforce an abstraction barrier between the representation/implementation and use of data.

## Sequences

A sequence is an ordered collection of values.

Common behavior of sequences:
- finite length
- every element corresponds to a non-negative integer index less than the sequence's length (starting at zero)

Examples of sequences:
- lists
- ranges
- tuples
- arrays
- strings
- linked lists (non-native)

## Mutable Data

Instances of primitive built-in objects are typically immutable.

Mutable objects represent values that change over time.

## Object-Oriented Programming

Like functions, classes create abstraction barriers between the use and representation of data.

Objects respond to behavioral requests and have local state.

Objects abstract the complexity of both state and behavior.

A class is a template. An object is an instance of a class.
