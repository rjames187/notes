# Interpreters

## Functional Programming

Unlike machine languages, high-level languages hide concerns about the representation of data and programs

High-level languages have means of combination and abstraction

## Structure of an Interpreter

An interpreter can evaluate expressions and apply them

Both evaluation and application may be recursive functions

## Scope

Lexical scope (static scope): the parent of a frame is the environment in which a procedure was defined
Dynamic scope: the parent of a frame is the environment in which a procedure was called
