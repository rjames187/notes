## Types of Programming

### Imperative Programming

Describe what you want a computer to do

Involves mutation to compute a result

Computational efficiency determined by details of the program

Object-oriented programming is useful for organizing imperative programmings

### Declarative Programming

Describe the result you want the computer to produce

Abstracts away details of how memory is changing during computation

Computational efficiency determined by the interpreter or language

Functional programming describes a result using function composition

## Types of Programming Languages

### General Purpose:

### Domain-specific:

Designed to solve a particular class of problems

Examples are SQL, HTML, CSS, regular expressions

Often declarative, often embedded into general purpose languages
